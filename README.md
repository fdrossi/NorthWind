# NorthWind
The North Wind is characterized by a set of metrics, defined as (i) wind velocity above 4 meters per second; (ii) wind direction with an angle between 300ยบ (W-NW) and 30ยบ (N-NE); and (iii) temperature above 90% percentile of the mean temperature of the period. If these three conditions are detected at the same instant of time in a minimum period of 4 hours, there is the occurrence of North Wind. Therefore, its detection can be performed through an analysis of outliers about time series that contain the three previously mentioned variables. The outliers analysis is performed on data from established meteorological stations in the central region of RS and allows to characterize and detect the occurrence of the North Wind (using historical series of meteorological stations).
